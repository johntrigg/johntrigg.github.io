# Introduction

The DOE 2023 Cyberforce Competition, held an hour from Chicago in the depths of a biting winter, turned out to be a remarkable showcase of our team's cybersecurity prowess. Against a backdrop of 106 teams, we achieved an impressive fifth place, a feat that fills me with immense pride.
# Key Advantages and Team Strengths

Our team's success hinged on several key factors: the robustness of our website, the thoroughness of our security documentation, and our exemplary performance during red team engagements. Our website, in particular, stood out as a testament to our technical skill and attention to detail.
# Strategic Approaches

One of our strategic advantages was the focus on setting up comprehensive visibility on our endpoints. This approach allowed us to track every move of the red team, understanding their actions command by command, second by second. This level of insight was crucial in countering their strategies effectively.
# Personal Contributions

My role in this success story was multifaceted. I took the lead in crafting detailed security documentation, which involved a deep analysis of our network from both technical and security perspectives. Alongside the team captain, I was involved in the intricate task of upgrading the website, ensuring its integration with ICS/SCADA data from solar panels and batteries.
# Reflections and Lessons Learned

While we are incredibly proud of our fifth-place finish, hindsight has revealed areas where we could improve. This realization is not a setback but a stepping stone for future growth and success.
# Looking Forward

With the lessons learned this year, our sights are firmly set on placing in the top three in the next competition. We have identified key areas for improvement and are eager to implement strategies that will elevate our performance.
# Conclusion

The DOE 2023 Cyberforce Competition was not just a competition; it was a journey of learning, teamwork, and achievement. It has instilled in us a spirit of continuous improvement and an unwavering determination to reach new heights in the field of cybersecurity.
