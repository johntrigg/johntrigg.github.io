# Conquering DEFCON 32: Our Journey to Second Place at the Adversary Wars CTF

DEFCON 32 was an experience like no other, and I had the privilege of competing in the Adversary Wars CTF at the Adversary Village. This was no ordinary competition—it was an intense, high-stakes contest with 78 teams from all over, each with 1-3 members, making up around 100 participants. Unlike many CTFs, there were no restrictions on who could participate, except for one: you had to be at DEFCON and get a sign-up code in person from the organizers. What made it even more special was that no other college had a representative team. It was just me and Waseem, battling it out against some of the best in the world.

# The Dream Team: Just Me and Gerbsec
Going into the competition, I couldn’t have asked for a better teammate than Waseem 'Gerbsec'. We were a under the max team size of 3 (and there were groups of more than 3 competing), but our synergy made up for our size. Waseem brought his A-game, tackling challenges in areas like web exploitation, penetration testing, and threat intelligence, while I focused on my favorite domain: OSINT, a bit of penetration testing, and threat intelligence..

The OSINT challenges were particularly thrilling for me. They required a different kind of thinking—a mix of creativity, persistence, and a knack for finding needles in digital haystacks. Each OSINT challenge presented a unique puzzle that demanded a blend of research skills and intuition. The satisfaction of uncovering hidden information in a sea of data was unparalleled, and I was grateful to have Waseem covering the other areas, allowing me to dive deep into these challenges.

# The Competition: High-Stakes and High-Energy
The atmosphere at DEFCON 32 was electric. With 78 teams vying for the top spot, the competition was fierce. The challenges were a well-rounded mix, focusing on Web Exploitation, Penetration Testing, OSINT, Threat Intelligence, and Forensics. Every challenge tested different aspects of our skills, and each one pushed us to our limits.

Despite the pressure, Waseem and I maintained our focus, working methodically through each challenge. The adrenaline of being in such a competitive environment, surrounded by some of the brightest minds in cybersecurity, was both exhilarating and exhausting. Yet, as each hour passed, our confidence grew. We knew we were in the running for a top spot.

# The Result: Second Place and a World of Memories
When the final results were announced, and we saw our team in second place, it was a moment of pure elation. Out of 78 teams, many of which were comprised of highly skilled professionals, we had managed to secure a spot on the podium. It was a testament to our teamwork, determination, and the countless hours we had put into honing our skills.

# Conclusion: More Than Just a Competition
Reflecting on our experience at DEFCON 32, it’s clear that this competition was about more than just winning. It was about the camaraderie between Waseem and me, the thrill of tackling complex challenges, and the satisfaction of knowing that we could hold our own against some of the best in the field. The OSINT challenges will always stand out in my memory as a personal highlight, but the real reward was the journey we took together as a team.

As I look back, I realize that while the trophy was nice, the real prize was the experience itself. Competing at DEFCON 32 with Waseem, making new memories, and pushing our skills to the limit was an opportunity I’ll cherish forever. Here’s to many more challenges, more competitions, and more unforgettable experiences in the world of cybersecurity!
