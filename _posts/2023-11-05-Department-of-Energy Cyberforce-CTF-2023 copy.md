# Introduction

In the heart of a frigid winter, an hour away from Chicago, IL, I found myself facing one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my life: the Department of Energyâ€™s 2023 Cyberforce Competition. As someone accustomed to the milder winters of Florida, the cold was as much a challenge as the competition itself.
# Competition Structure and Key Components

The competition was a rigorous test of our cybersecurity skills, divided into several key areas key areas: crafting detailed security documentation, fixing and configuring network vulnerabilities, responding to red-team engagements in real time, and focusing on securing ICS/SCADA systems. This multi-faceted approach tested our technical know-how and strategic thinking.
# Personal Contributions and Achievements

My primary responsibility was leading the security documentation. This involved writing an extensive document that inventoried, categorized, detailed, and analyzed our network from both technical and security standpoints. Additionally, we prepared a video presentation aimed at C-suite executives to advocate for enhanced security measures. Alongside the team captain, I tackled the complex task of upgrading the provided website, integrating data from solar panels and batteries using a tech stack that included React, NodeJS, and more.
# Challenges Faced and Overcome

The website upgrade was no easy feat, especially given its reliance on ICS/SCADA data. Adapting to the harsh winter conditions, especially compared to Florida's milder climate, was another personal battle. These challenges, however, only added to the sense of achievement upon completion.
# Team Dynamics and Collaboration

Working closely with the team captain and other members, our collaboration was key to our success. Our team was a melting pot of diverse skills, from forensics and reverse engineering to cryptography and web exploitation, all of which were crucial in the CTF challenges.
# Conclusion

The DOE 2023 Cyberforce Competition was more than just a test of cybersecurity skills; it was a battle against the elements and a journey of personal and professional growth. The experience has left me with valuable lessons and a burning desire to continue participating in such enriching competitions.
