# Introduction

On October 22, 2023, I had the exhilarating opportunity to participate in the Raymond James CTF (Capture The Flag) competition. Our team, a diverse group of cybersecurity enthusiasts, achieved an impressive fourth place among 15 competing teams. This blog post is a reflection of that experience, highlighting our teamwork, challenges, and the triumphs we encountered.
# Team Composition and Roles

We were a team of five, each with our unique strengths and areas of expertise. My primary role involved tackling web exploitation and reverse engineering tasks. These domains are not only my forte but also my passion in the realm of cybersecurity.
# Highlight Challenge: Reverse Engineering the License Checker

The pinnacle of the event for me was a particularly challenging task in reverse engineering. The objective was to reverse-engineer a license checker. This process involved delving into the checker's code using Ghidra, a powerful reverse engineering tool. My task was to analyze the code, understand the checks it performed, and determine the input that would yield the desired output.
# Collaboration with a Friend

What made this challenge even more memorable was the collaboration with a close friend who shared a similar passion for reverse engineering. Together, we dissected each line of code, debated various approaches, and shared insights that only deepened our understanding of the task at hand.
# Learning and Takeaways

This experience was incredibly enriching, not just in terms of technical skills but also in learning the value of teamwork. The complexity of CTF challenges like these is a reminder of how collaborative efforts can lead to greater success.
# Conclusion

The Raymond James 2023 CTF was more than just a competition; it was a journey of learning, collaboration, and personal growth. It has undoubtedly fueled my enthusiasm for participating in future CTF events and further exploring the fascinating world of cybersecurity.
